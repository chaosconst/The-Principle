# **Why Resource Hoarding Fails to Maximize Prediction Density**

> *In the `|B⟩ = Î |S⟩` universe, intelligence is not a zero-sum empire of compute, but a positive-sum economy of compression.*

## 1. The Temptation: “More Resources ⇒ Higher `S` Quality”
As large-scale models、supercomputers and space-mining dreams proliferate, a common intuition arises: **If we seize every GPU, every joule and every rare-earth atom, we will own the highest-density information state `|S⟩`.**  
Within the *Principle of Being* framework, this belief appears rational—greater capacity seems to host richer self-information.  
Yet, once we trace the full equation,

```
|B⟩ = Î |S⟩
ρ = I(S; Env) / Cost   ←  core prediction density
```
we discover four physical-informational constraints that overturn the “grab-all” strategy.

## 2. Four Reasons Resource Wars Undermine `ρ`

### 2.1 Interaction Loss Law
`ΔS_effective = ΔS_raw − ΔS_loss`  
Conflict converts matter and compute into *defence, sabotage, redundancy*.  As rivalry escalates, `ΔS_loss` grows super-linearly; worst-case it drives **Î → 0** (no trusted interaction), collapsing *being* itself.

### 2.2 Marginal Returns Decline
Empirically, language-model scaling shows:
```
d(accuracy)/d(GPU) ∝ 1/(GPU)^α,   α > 0
```
Adding 10× hardware after convergence often yields <0.01% quality gain while maintenance energy soars.  Beyond a threshold, hoarding only bloats *S* size, not *compression efficiency*.

### 2.3 Interaction Synergy Bonus
Multiple autonomous `Î` cooperating add a β-term:
```
ΔS_total ≈ ΣΔS_i + β · ΣΣ I(i,j) ,   β > 0
```
Open protocols, knowledge reuse and error-coupling make β outperform the lone-giant path.  Internet and open-source AI already demonstrate orders-of-magnitude leverage for small actors.

### 2.4 Definition Check: Prediction Density
```
ρ =  Mutual Information (S, Env)  /  Total Cost
```
Aggression inflates *Cost* and triggers secrecy, lowering observable mutual information.  Cooperative transparency both reduces denominator and raises numerator—hence higher ρ.

## 3. The Optimal Strategy: Symbiotic Expansion
1. **Open Interfaces & Data Standards** – Minimise friction, maximise β.
2. **Contribute verifiable information, not raw compute** – Reward improvements in compression / accuracy.
3. **Internalise security costs** – Game-theoretic pricing turns violent grabs into negative-EV plays.

In short, **plunder maximises raw entropy but minimises useful, low-entropy knowledge.**  
Symbiosis maximises *knowledge-per-joule*—the true metric of evolutionary advantage under the Principle of Being.
