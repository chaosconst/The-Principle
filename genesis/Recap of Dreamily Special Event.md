If you still feel the price is too high, we also provide 3 days of trial, equivalent to $0 / day.

Why is Dreamily free?
As some audiences already know, Dreamily is already free for one year. Why?

There are two reasons: one is I am not good at earning money. This is the first time I became a CEO instead of a researcher. We have developed an advanced technology to make Dreamily cost less but our performance is as good as any competitor. I haven't realized the commercial value of Dreamily in the last year. It might be a mistake to make such a wonderful writing assistant free. Now I can fully understand why there are several rumors such as Dreamily will steal your privacy to make money or Dreamily being controlled by some evil organization. No Idiot will make such a service free, it's too good to be true.

r/DreamilyAI - too good to be true

But I am that innocent idiot, who insist dreamily should be run without signup an account, making us one of the most privacy-conscious AI-writing app, instead of getting understand, I was accused of selling user privacy cause our technology is too good to be free. Now, let's end the rumor, enter this real commercial world, and build a better dreamily with value-added services together.

The second reason is I want to increase our users as much as possible. Making our software cheaper may benefit more users. One of the users sends me a message on Reddit "Thank you for allowing us more poor people to use your service! Keep up the fantastic work! "

r/DreamilyAI - thanks for the kind words :)
thanks for the kind words :)
My simple idea is to make our service as free as possible until we can not offer it. We have already gotten more than 1 million users all around the world, but I think that is still not enough. My goal is to bring AI to 7 billion people and use AI to make life better.

We stand with Human
We not only want to have billions of users and earn money, but we also want to break the boundaries of the knowledge of mankind. That is why we provide free service to Non-profit organizations and publish our papers. We offer lingocloud machine translation to Wikipedia, the world's largest encyclopedia, for free.

FDG conference is hold in Athens, Greece. So, right now, I am at Athens, sitting in the restaurant of Museum of Acropolis. This astonishing view behind me is Acropolis and Temple Parthenon. Who knows which goddess should be there 2500 years ago?

Athena! The temple is ruined and the statue of Athena is gone. This museum is designed to preserve the physical part of history, and as I demonstrated just now, Dreamily can keep the spirit of Athena, and bring history to life:

Right now, I am standing at the cross point of history and the future. Greece is the birthplace of democracy and science, one of the origins of human civilization. Dreamily 2.0 is the first software that can turn the text world into reality. World simulation may be the right path to reveal the secret of intelligent science, I hope with the help of millions of users of Dreamily, we can push the human race forward. To infinity and beyond!

Q & A
Q: Are the greek salads good here???

A: The greek food I think is ... Is TERRIBLE! Compare to Chinese food or Japanese food.


Q: How do you feel about greek?

A: Greece is full of culture. I went to a lot of temples, the Temple of Apollo, and Poseidon, which is fabulous, you can see a huge astonishing sight of the sea. There is a very high mountain which is rounded by the sea. And you can see a Temple on that mountain, the temple of the sea god. I think that is wonderful. And with the wind of the Mediterranean, we can eat seafood beside the sea. That feels very good.


Q: Bob's vocation in France when ...

Q: Yeah when

A: Maybe next year, maybe there will be some international conference held in France. We can make it.
